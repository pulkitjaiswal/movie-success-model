Installation
------------

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project, I was interestested in using the latest IMDB dataset to better understand:

1.  Do certain movie genres make more money than others?
2.  Does the amount of funding for a movie have an impact on commercial success?
3.  What impact does duration have on the success of a movie?
4.  Do user ratings have an effect on how well a movie performs commercially?
5.  What about the number of votes – as a proxy for popularity?

There is only 1 notebook in the repository that showcases work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. The comment associated with each code line is sufficieint in gaining an understanding of the methodology.

As the IMDB dataset is available freely for download, I have made the dataset available in the "datasets" folder. There is an additional imdb_clean.csv which is produced after performing the cleaning opertions on the dataset.
